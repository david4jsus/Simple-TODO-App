# Simple-TODO-App
A simple TODO web app made for practice (hopefully with better JavaScript than I've previously writen).

<b>Features:</b>
- Organize TODO items into different projects
- Edit TODO items to include priorities and due dates
- Sort TODO items for personalized organization
- See all TODO items from all projects
- Different themes for customization (don't expect anything pretty, though, I'm not a UI or graphic designer)

<i>Is it functional?</i>

Yep.

<i>Is it pretty?</I>

Umm... define pretty.

<i>Will this project be further developed?</i>

Maybe (depends on how much I end up using this app and whether I want to clean up the code a bit before expanding on it).
